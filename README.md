# About this Project

This is an experimental project, the main goal was to create an App that heavily relies on value types instead of reference types.
This project is used as proof for the overall architecture discussed in this talk: [Safer Swift Code with Value Types](https://speakerdeck.com/benjamin_encz/safer-swift-code-with-value-types).
