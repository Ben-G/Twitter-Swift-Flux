# WARNING!

This is an experimental project, the main goal was to create an App that heavily relies on value types instead of reference types.
This project is used as proof for the overall architecture discussed in this talk: [Safer Swift Code with Value Types](http://bit.ly/saferswift).

The implementation details of this project do not represent best practices! Errors are not handled, optional are forcefully unwrapped in potentially dangerous places. Please take this project with multiple grains of salt! The project also isn't complete. Filters, e.g. are implemented and working but haven't been hooked up to the UI yet.
